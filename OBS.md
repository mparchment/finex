**Project Name:** Full-Stack Online Banking System

**Project Description:** This project aims to create a comprehensive online banking system with functionalities such as account management, transaction tracking, fund transfers, and a financial advisory section. The system will be user-friendly, offering a responsive design and a seamless experience across different devices. It will showcase proficiency in front-end and back-end development, automated delivery pipelines, unit testing, and API integration.

**Detailed Plan:**

1. **Define Requirements:** Start with understanding the necessary functionalities and features for your online banking system. Define the types of user roles (e.g., customer, administrator, bank staff) and outline their respective permissions. List the core features such as user authentication, account management, transaction history, and fund transfers.

2. **Design Database Schema:** Identify key entities such as users, accounts, and transactions. Define relationships between these entities and decide on suitable data structures and validations to ensure data integrity.

   - Entities: User (bank customers, admins, and staff), Account (individual bank accounts associated with users), Transaction (details of financial transactions between accounts)
   - Tables and Relationships: User table (user_id, name, email, password (hashed), role), Account table (account_id, user_id, account_number, balance), Transaction table (transaction_id, source_account_id, destination_account_id, amount, timestamp)
   - Primary keys for each table, foreign key constraints, data types, lengths for each field, constraints and triggers, normalization, indexing, and performance optimizations

3. **Set Up the Backend:** Initialize a Node.js environment and install required dependencies, including Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB driver, etc. Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and set up API endpoints for user registration, login, account management, transaction processing, etc. Create middleware for error handling, request validation, logging, and security.

4. **Develop the Frontend:** Set up a React project with TypeScript. Design the UI considering usability, accessibility, and responsive design. Create screens and components for user registration, login, account management, transaction history, fund transfers, etc. Integrate the frontend with the backend APIs to fetch and update data, and implement form validation and error handling.

5. **Implement Core Features:**
   - User Registration: Allow users to register with the necessary details.
   - User Login: Implement login functionality with JWT and authenticate users against stored credentials.
   - Account Management: Enable users to manage their bank accounts, including checking balance and accessing account statements.
   - Transaction Processing: Implement fund transfer logic with proper validation and security measures.
   - Transaction History: Provide a feature for users to view their transaction history, including transaction details like date, amount, sender/receiver information, etc.

6. **Enhance Security:** 
   - Secure Communication: Implement secure communication protocols like HTTPS.
   - Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.
   - Password Storage: Hash and salt user passwords securely.
   - Access Control and Authorization: Implement a robust access control mechanism.
   - Logging and Auditing: Implement comprehensive logging of system activities and user actions.
   - Error Handling and Reporting: Handle errors gracefully and monitor system errors.
   - Regular Updates and Patching: Keep all software components, libraries, and frameworks up to date.
   - Security Testing: Perform regular security assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews.
   - Compliance with Regulations: Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations such as GDPR or PCI DSS.

7. **Testing and Debugging:** Write unit tests for both backend and frontend code to verify functionality and identify potential issues. Perform integration testing to ensure seamless communication between the frontend and backend. Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix any errors or bugs.

8. **Automated Delivery Pipeline:** Set up a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using a tool like Jenkins or similar. This will automate the testing and deployment of code changes, ensuring the software remains in a release-ready state throughout its lifecycle.

9. **Deployment and Production:** Configure the application for deployment to a hosting platform or

**Final Product:** The end result will be a secure and fully functional online banking system that provides a top-notch user experience, adheres to best practices in coding and software development, and showcases a wide array of skills and technologies. The application will demonstrate an in-depth understanding of both the technical requirements and business needs of the financial services sector.
